2009-10-13 FIX: correct varbylab display to use title font face, not header font face.

2009-11-10 FIX: trunkation with RD alignment. This manifests itself very rarely and font calculations 
                indicate that there is enough space to fit, but last character of the text is sometimes 
                ommited.
2009-11-12 FIX: incorrect repeated text in first column on the top of the page. This manifests itself very 
                rearly when keepn=1 is used. 
                
2009-12_06 FIX: changed conversion of float to twips, before floor of points was taken first, then multiplied by 20, 
                new conversion first multiplies by 20, then converts to int.
                
2009-12-15 FIX: when RTF file grid is visible, the right most grid edge aligns properly between system header, titles, body rows and footers.

2010-01-28 FIX: when footer tabs are used and the first footer does not have a tab, generated PDF and RTF did not use proper
                spacing above the footer and no divider bar above footer
                
2010_02_10 FIX: Fixed potential problem: distance to next for col 0 may throw arroy out of bounds

2010_03_16 FIX: If extra line was requested after the row, it was padded (the hight was larger than normal for this empty line).
				This has been fixed.
				
2010_03_17 FIX If no RTF output is requested PDF bottom space is no longer increased for compatibility with RTF

Client MARCH DELIVERY

2010-06-07 IMPROVEMENT text weighted streching adds now fixed even amount to pre-streched columns according to prefered widths (if there is space left),

           FIX - applies ceiling and converts marigins to round integer values (in  points). 
            iText may have problem rendering pages if marigin size in not rounded up point value
